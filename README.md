# EL Hedaya Islamic School Website

Public-facing Sunday School website for **EL Hedaya Islamic School / Clemmons Islamic Center**, wrapped around the existing secure Parent Portal at:

`https://school.clemmonsislamiccenter.org`

## Current website sections

- Premium EL Hedaya hero and official school logo
- About the school
- Programs
- Picture Gallery
- Sunday schedule and $150 semester fee
- Policies
- Parent Portal / Registration CTA
- Contact and location information
- Responsive desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts

## Picture Gallery

The public gallery supports:

- Responsive modern photo grid
- Click/tap photo lightbox
- Keyboard previous/next navigation on desktop
- Optional photo title and caption
- Public users can view published images only

## Private Gallery Administration

**There is no Gallery Admin button, menu item, footer link, empty-gallery admin link, or other public link to the administration area.**

The private administration route is:

`/school-gallery-admin`

Bookmark that URL for administrators. Do not add it to public navigation.

Hiding the route is intentionally only a convenience/privacy measure. It is **not** the security boundary. Production security is enforced by:

1. Supabase Authentication
2. Required admin role in `app_metadata`
3. Row Level Security on the gallery table
4. Storage policies restricting upload/delete to authenticated admins

Even if someone guesses the admin URL, they cannot add or delete photos without an authorized admin account.

### Production safety behavior

If Supabase is not configured on a deployed production build, the admin page is disabled instead of silently granting local admin access.

Local preview administration is available only while running Vite in development mode.

## Admin capabilities

After successful admin authentication:

- Upload JPG, PNG, WEBP, or GIF files
- Add a picture from a direct image URL
- Add an optional title and caption
- Delete existing gallery pictures

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:5173/school-gallery-admin`

Local development mode can be used to preview the gallery manager before Supabase is connected.

## Connect Supabase for the live gallery

### 1. Run the provided SQL

Open your Supabase project and run:

`supabase/gallery.sql`

This creates:

- `school_gallery` table
- Public read policy
- Admin-only insert/update/delete policies
- `school-gallery` public Storage bucket
- Storage policies for gallery files

### 2. Create or use an admin user

Create the administrator in **Supabase Authentication > Users**.

The user must have this Supabase `app_metadata` value:

```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

The frontend checks the role for the interface, while the database and Storage RLS policies enforce authorization server-side.

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_PORTAL_URL=https://school.clemmonsislamiccenter.org
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY
VITE_GALLERY_TABLE=school_gallery
VITE_GALLERY_BUCKET=school-gallery
```

Only use the public Supabase anon/publishable key in Vite. Never put a Supabase service-role key or any other secret administrator key in frontend environment variables.

### 4. Configure Vercel

Add the same `VITE_*` variables to the public website's Vercel project and redeploy.

`vercel.json` contains a rewrite for the private gallery-admin route so directly opening/bookmarking the route works after deployment.

## Key files

- `src/components/Gallery.jsx` - public gallery and lightbox only
- `src/components/GalleryAdminPage.jsx` - private admin route UI
- `src/services/galleryService.js` - local/Supabase data layer
- `supabase/gallery.sql` - database, RLS, and Storage setup
- `src/App.jsx` - public site / private admin route switch
- `vercel.json` - direct-route rewrite for Vercel


## V3 gallery architecture

- The homepage no longer displays school photos. It contains a lightweight **Life at EL Hedaya** call-to-action only.
- Public gallery page: `/gallery`
- Hidden administration route: `/school-gallery-admin`
- The public gallery supports fullscreen viewing, previous/next navigation, keyboard arrows, mobile swipe, zoom controls, photo count, lazy image loading, and incremental **Load More** rendering.
- Admins may save new photos as **Published** or **Hidden**, and can toggle visibility later without deleting the image.
- There is no public link to the admin route. Supabase authentication and Row Level Security remain the actual security boundary.

## Homepage gallery preview

The **Life at EL Hedaya** section now automatically selects one random **published**
gallery photo each time the homepage loads. It uses the same gallery data source as
`/gallery`, so newly published photos are automatically eligible to appear on the homepage.

If no published gallery photos are available, the official EL Hedaya school logo is used
as a graceful fallback. Unpublished/hidden photos are never selected.
